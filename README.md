I have programmed a beginner's guide to France. The webiste features sections on popular destinations, French Cuisine and movie and music recommendations.

My aim for the project was to learn about CSS animations. Therefore, I picked a fairly straightforward subject which had clear topic areas I could focus on. To start, I watched various YouTube videos on basic CSS animations, in addition to reading some interactive articles. After doing this, I picked out specific animations I liked the look of and followed guides on how to implement them. 


For the design of the website, I used the French flag's colours throughout. I found pictures for each section on Canva, and used the design feature to give them the required colours. 

Even though the marquee features was difficult to implement, I think it really boosts the design of the website. I also enjoyed learning about different hover animations to reveal hidden content. Given that this is my third web project, I was able to make this project much more easily. This makes me happy because it reflects all the work I have done over the past few months.

Overall, even though the project is fairly short, it was a great excersise to continue practicing my web skills, while also learning new features!
